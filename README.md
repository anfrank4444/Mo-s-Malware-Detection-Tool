# Mo-s-Malware-Detection-Tool
Moâ€™s Malware Detection Tool is a Python-based application designed to assist users in identifying potentially malicious files on their system. It employs a graphical user interface built using the Tkinter library, making it user-friendly and accessible. 
The tool operates by analyzing the header of selected files to detect specific "magic numbers" associated with known malware file types. These magic numbers are unique byte sequences found at the beginning of certain file types, providing a signature that can indicate the file's nature.
